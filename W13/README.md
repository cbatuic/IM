# Database: PrestigeCars
The database PrestigeCars is designed to manage information related to car sales, staff, stock, and yearly sales. It contains several tables, each with its specific purpose, and helps the business track various aspects of its operations. Here's a simple description of the database and a use case:

### Database: PrestigeCars

Tables Included:
1. staff: This table keeps track of the employees who work in the company. It stores their ID, name, manager, and department.
2. stock: This table contains information about the cars in stock. Each car has a unique stock code and details such as model, cost, repairs, parts, transport cost, color, and buyer comments.
3. yearlysales: This table records all the sales made in a specific year. It includes the make and model of the car, the customer who bought it, the country, costs involved, sale price, and the date of the sale.

Use Case:
A car dealership uses the PrestigeCars database to manage its car inventory and track sales performance. For example:

* Managing Stock: The dealership can look up which cars are currently in stock, their costs, and if any repairs were done. This information is stored in the stock table.
* Tracking Sales: When a car is sold, details like the buyerâ€™s name, the sale price, and the date of the sale are recorded in the yearlysales table. This helps the dealership see how many cars were sold each year and which models are most popular.
* Managing Staff: The staff table helps the dealership keep track of its employees, including their roles and departments.

This database supports the dealership in organizing its operations, helping to ensure efficient inventory management and successful sales tracking.
